## 🧠 Features Powered by GPT

- **Auto-categorization** of expenses using natural language prompts
- **Smart monthly summary** via GPT (e.g., "You spent more on Transport this month")
- Easily extensible to add budget suggestions, trend analysis, and insights

## 🔐 JWT Authentication with Spring Security

We implemented JWT-based authentication to secure the API:

- User registration & login endpoints
- Passwords hashed using BCrypt
- JWT generation and validation
- Protected routes for expense CRUD operations

### Sample Auth Flow

1. `POST /auth/register` → Register a user
2. `POST /auth/login` → Returns JWT
3. Send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` in all future requests

## 🧾 Expense Creation + GPT Categorization

Users can create expenses by sending descriptions like:

- `Lunch at Pizza Hut`
- `Uber to Colombo`
- `Bought groceries from Keells`

If the category is not provided, the app will:

1. Call OpenAI's GPT API with the description
2. Receive a category like Food, Transport, Shopping
3. Save it in MongoDB with timestamp and user reference

## 🗓️ Monthly Summary API (AI Generated)

We built an API that gives smart monthly summaries using GPT:

> *"In July, you spent 45% on Food, followed by 25% on Transport. Your spending increased compared to June."*

This is generated by sending categorized expense data to GPT and asking it to generate a friendly summary.
